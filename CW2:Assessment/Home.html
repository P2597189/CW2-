<!-- The layout used in order to create this webpage was assited and used on W3school
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp

The div class 'shoe' is given to the whole of the gallery that is made within
the website including the text, pictures and the external links for the images. the
text and images are in a separate div container, this is so that it makes it easier
to style in the CSS phase of the website making.

the anchor element is placed into another Div element within the initial 'shoe'
div called gallery. this is so that when the images of the shoes are clicked on
by the user, it brings them onto an external website where they can buy the shoe.

the 'img' element is used here to place the image of the shoe. it is in a div container
with the anchor element to ensure that the link and picture are joined together.

The last div element 'Description' is used within the 'shoe' div container. This
is so that i was able to talk about the shoe and where it is from.
